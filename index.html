     pillbugs have a black or brown body and frequently white or yellow spots, pillbugs are whats known as detritivores which means the eat dead or decaying vegetable matter, such as leaves.<br>
    while roly polies live on land, they actually still have gills which means they require moisture to survive,
    when they are in the wild they like to be under rocks or other moisture trapping objects if it hasnt rained in a while,
    but when it does rain they are able to go around to eat and find a new place to stay until next time it rains<br>
    <h2>how to care for isopods</h2>
    isopods typically require very little care, most daily reqirements are watering every 2-3 days. but remember to give them decaying plant matter, such as leaves, to feed on when there isnt much plant matter, and also change the soil every 1-1.5 years
